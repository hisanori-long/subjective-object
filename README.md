## 『Subjective Object』

 Shadows are present in our lives every day, but there are many times when they are thought of as "just an object that moves along with the movement of the subject". When we humans walk down the street, we recognize "ourselves"through our interactions with our shadows, but we rarely have the experience of recognizing objects in the outside world by their shadows. The "subjective object" means "object with subjectivity", and by using a robot named Toio and combining it with visual effects, the relationship between the moving object and its shadow changes over the time it takes to view the work. On the other hand, this "objective object" is also a metaphor for "human being," and although we think that we are spending our lives with our own subjectivity, we may actually be unconsciously spending our lives according to our "shadow selves" constructed according to the rules in the social environment.
